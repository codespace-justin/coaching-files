#  JSON:

## Details:

JSON data is in 'Key' : 'Value' pairs

'Key' : 'Value' pairs are separated by commas (,)

    Objects should be encapsulated by curly braces {}
    Arrays should be encapsulated by square brackets []

## Main Uses:
JSON is a file format that is able to store complex data, is lightweight, and is therefore often to use to send data
between applications whilst maintaining data integrity.

    - JSON is able to store Strings using different quotations, commas and bracket patterns

    - Programming languages are recognize Objects and their properties inside the String due to the help of the aformentioned pattern
      of quotes/brackets/etc.

    - The String is then converted into an Object of that programming language using some method/function that is able to decipher/parse
      JSON

## Basically elaborate on Coding vs programming

Explain how programming focuses on logic instead of presentation


How programming uses presentation to mask the logic/code behind the functionality


#### Programming vs Software Development

Basically just examplain the leap between working with basic programming concepts such as loops, vars, etc, 
and using those building blocks to build software solutions that solve a problem or acheive some goal

#### Basics of Application Processing

- input 
- process
- output
- Maybe have students include comments to denotate when they are doing what for the first few challenges?

#### Layout of Applications

- Frontend 

    - Presentation
    - Interactivity
    - Maintaning App State
    - Communication

- Backend
    
    - Communication
    - Processing

- Database

    - Persistence
    - Communication

Explain how this application layout can be applied to the frontend alone, which further reiterates how similar and flexible programming languages are.

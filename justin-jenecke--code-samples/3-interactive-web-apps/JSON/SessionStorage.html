    Session storage

    Check the console for output of JavaScript code
    <script>

        //Eg #2:

        let obj = {name: "Lyndon", 
                age: 42, 
                address: 
                    {suburb : "South", city : "Cape Town", code : 8001}
                };

        let obj2 = {
            name: 'justin',
            age: '23',
            likes: 'coffee'
        };  
        

        //Convert obj2 to JSON String
        //Saving JSON String to variable obj2JSON
        let obj2JSON = JSON.stringify(obj2);
  
        //Printing both obj2 and obj2JSON to console to compare difference
        console.log(obj2);
        console.log(obj2JSON);


        //save obj2JSON to session storage
        sessionStorage.setItem("exampleJson", obj2JSON);

        //get exampleJSON from session storage and save it back to obj2JSON
        obj2JSON = sessionStorage.getItem("exampleJson");

        console.log(obj2JSON);

        obj2 = JSON.parse(obj2JSON);

        console.log(obj2);

        /*
            Notes:

            The whole point of this example is simply to convert a JavaSctipt object to JSON,
            save it to session storage, get it back from session storage, convert it back to 
            JavaScript, and log the JavaScript object back to the console.

            1.  In this example we are taking the object obj2 declared on line 23 and we converting
                it into a JSON string on line 32 and saving it to a new variable called obj2JSON

            2.  line 40 saves this JSON string to session storage and it will remain there as long as
                the tab remains open.

            3.  line 43 looks for an object in session storage with the id of "exampleJson" and gets
                it back from session storage. After this it puts the JSON string from session back into 
                the variable called obj2JSON
                
            4.  line 47 converts the JSON string stored in obJSON2 back into a JavaScript object and
                puts it back into the variable obj2
            
        */

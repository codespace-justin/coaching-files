    local storage

    Check the console for output of JavaScript code
    <script>

        //Eg #2:

        let obj = {name: "Lyndon", 
                age: 42, 
                address: 
                    {suburb : "South", city : "Cape Town", code : 8001}
                }; 

        //Convert obj to JSON String
        //Saving JSON String to variable objJSON
        let objJSON = JSON.stringify(obj);
  
        //Printing both obj and objJSON to console to compare difference
        console.log(obj);
        console.log(objJSON);


        //save objJSON to local storage
        localStorage.setItem("exampleJson", objJSON);

        //get exampleJSON from local storage and save it back to obj2JSON
        objJSON = localStorage.getItem("exampleJson");

        console.log(objJSON);

        obj2 = JSON.parse(objJSON);

        console.log(obj);

        /*
            Notes:

            The whole point of this example is simply to convert a JavaSctipt object to JSON,
            save it to local storage, get it back from local storage, convert it back to 
            JavaScript, and log the JavaScript object back to the console.

            1.  In this example we are taking the object obj2 declared on line 23 and we converting
                it into a JSON string on line 32 and saving it to a new variable called obj2JSON

            2.  line 40 saves this JSON string to local storage and it save the data locally to your
                computer anbd when remain there even after you close your browser

            3.  line 43 looks for an object in local storage with the id of "exampleJson" and gets
                it back from local storage. After this it puts the JSON string from local back into 
                the variable called objJSON
                
            4.  line 47 converts the JSON string stored in obJSON back into a JavaScript object and
                puts it back into the variable obj

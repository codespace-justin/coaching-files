# VUE.js Coach notes and learner handouts:
    
    Justin Jenecke
    Code Coach & Student Manager

These are notes compiled and written as an supplement to the existing course material on the CodeSpace LMS.

This course focus more on the traditional use of Vue as an MVC framework for building single-page-applications, as opposed to a replacement for vanilla JavaScript (how the LMS course material uses it).

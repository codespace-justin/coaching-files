    - Data Selector

## Box Model

    - Margin: Outer layer, refers to the space outside your elements. Usually used for positioning or spacing different elements.

    - Border: Middle layer between your margin and padding, essentially surrounds the element itself.

    - Padding: Refers to the space inside the element itself, and wraps around an elements content. Usually used spacing content, gaps, or to 
      align content.

    - Content refers to the text/images/links/etc. inside the element itself

## Positioning

    - Static positioning positions elements and content in order according to the document flow, as they were coded (top-down, left to right).

    - Relative is similar to static except it removes element from the document flow, and allows one to specify an offset value realtive to its 
      parent container, using top, left, right or bottom (eg: top: 10px).

    - Absolute is similar to Relative positioning, except with Absolute the elements offset values are relative to any container with a position 
      other than static, and it completely ignores its parent container.

    - Fixed elements are elements that completely ignore the docuement flow and are fixed in a postion relative to the browser window, instead of any 
      element. Their positioing is persistent even when scrolling.
